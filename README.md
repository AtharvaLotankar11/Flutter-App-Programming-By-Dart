<h1>Flutter Development by Dart Programming</h1>

<p>I completed Angela Yu's Flutter course, which provided a comprehensive understanding of app development using the Flutter framework. 
Throughout the course, I learned how to build a variety of projects, gaining hands-on experience in creating real-world applications. 
The course started with a basic introduction to Flutter and Dart programming language, and gradually progressed to more complex projects. 
Key projects included building a simple "BMI Calculator," a "Quizzler" app, a "Todoey" task management app, a "Clima" weather app, and a "Destini" 
choice-based game. Additionally, the course covered creating a "Flash Chat" app with Firebase integration and a "Xylophone" music app. These projects allowed 
me to grasp Flutter's essential concepts, such as UI design, state management, and using APIs, while building fully functional applications step by step.</p>
